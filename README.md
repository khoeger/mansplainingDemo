Project: Mansplaining Experiment
Authors: Akeem Spencer, Junsu Kim, Katarina Hoeger, Pedro Schmitz

Problem Statement: Design an experimental procedure to test how mansplaining
correlates with the gender of a questioner.

We propose a experimental procedure, and will present the procedure, using
a sample set of questions and answers.
To carry out the experiment in real life, we would need to do this on a large
scale.
