Problem Statement: Design an experimental procedure to test how mansplaining
correlates with the gender of a questioner.

We propose a experimental procedure, and will present the procedure, using
a sample set of questions and answers.
To carry out the experiment in real life, we would need to do this on a larger
scale. 

Basic Experiment Steps:
- Have Users verbal ask questions.
- For each question:
	- label it with a unique question number
	- modulate the voice of the question asker in 3 ways 
	- store soundfiles in a database
	  (male frequency, female frequency, neutral frequency)
	- for each user looking to answer questions:
		- users have a predefined gender
		- user hears one randomly assigned version of a question
		- user answers
		- (voice mod. answer to gender's predefined pitch for user annonymity?)
		- answer gets rated as either mansplaining or not
		- (make metric for rating. currently admin decides)
		- info sent to database
	- pose each version of question multiple times to multiple people, 
	  so have sufficient sample size
- Make tables and charts and graphs (networks) analyzing all of results
